Simulates gravity in a 2d environment. Includes versions written in both C++ and QuickBasic. They have unique features that can create artistic-looking graphics, such as the ability to draw lines connecting every possible pair of objects, with or without erasing behind themselves as they move.

I think I never figured out how to get one of the features in the C++ version working or why it wouldn't work.

I also wrote a gravity simulator for Python, which could simulate gravity in any given number of dimensions and separated simulation from display so that you could display the X number of dimensions in any way you want, and I did some really interesting graphical things with that. I seem to have lost that program. =/ I also wrote one in Python that simulates gravitic attraction in 3d, shades the objects as spheres, and can actually display the field in 3d with the use of red and green 3d glasses. I think I lost that one too. =/
